-----Stray Dogs Bar-----

CONTENT WARNING - This content contains mentions of suicide (lighthearted and somewhat-serious), mentions of violence and underage drinking (by the standarts of Japan - Dazai is 18 years old in this). It never exeeds anything that happens in the source material, but proceed with caution.

This is the ghost/ukagaka of Dazai Osamu, based on manga series and (mostly) anime Bungou Stray Dogs by Kafka Asagiri and Sango Harukawa. WARNING - this thing includes headcanons and subpar writing that might be considered as OOC to some people. Take a sit in the bar Lupin and enjoy a company of this mysterious bandaged stranger.
Made in one week for Ukagaka Dream Team Ghost Jam 2024.

Dazai can do most standard Ghost functions, such as...

-emptying your recycle bin
-checking if you have new email (if you set your POP settings properly)
-setting an image as your desktop wallpaper

and he will also say random bits of dialogue while he's on your screen, though you can change the frequency of that in his config menu if you want him to talk more or less. WARNING - includes spoilers for Bungou Stray Dogs (at least first 2 seasons).

You can ask Dazai questions and order some drinks at the bar.

You can pet his head via stroking the top of his head with your mouse cursor. I don't recommend trying that until you befriend him enough though.

The longer you know him and more you talk to him, the more he will grow to know you. As the time goes on, he may start to say new things, and, depending on what he reveals, give more answers to questions. Made in 7 days, it may include a lot of mistakes and general oopsies, so be sure to sometimes check him for updates in his Functions menu. You can check on his mood through the stat screen in the menu, and you can also reset him if you want to undo what he knows of you.

Thanks for downloading him and have fun! Let me know if you run into any bugs or anything, I barely had any time to see how he functions myself, haha. You're also welcome to ask me more in-deep questions about how he works, or just send me your favourite moments or improvement suggestions.
