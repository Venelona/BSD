//--OpenSakuraMenu
//This is a bit of intro dialogue before the main character opens their menu. You can see below that there are three pieces of separate dialogue listed before it goes to MenuRun. The character will randomly choose one of those pieces of dialogue before opening the rest of their menu. You can customize this with individual greetings for the character, such as "Yes, %(username)?" or "Need something, %(username)?" or things like that. Note that none of the lines end with \e!
//The \b2 tag tells the ghost to use their big balloon for this dialogue. If your menu has a lot of stuff, this'll probably look better than the small one.
//If you don't want multiple responses before opening the menu, you can delete the dialogue and just leave MenuRun.

	--
	"\n\n\_q\b2" //The \n\n means two new lines as detailed in the walkthrough, and \_q means quick session, meaning all the text from this point on will display instantly instead of a few letters at a time like normal ghost dialogue.

	  //If the ghost has said something, it will then display this menu option. You can replace "Repeat Last Dialogue" with whatever caption you like, such as "What were you saying?" or "What did you say?" or "Could you repeat that?" or something like that.
	  
	  //*********************Advanced User Info*******************************
	  //These text boxes are meant for those who have an interest in expanding or using more complicated functions in their ghost. Also for my own reference in the future since I plan on using this template too, haha. If you have no interest in any of this and just want to keep things as simple as possible, feel free to skip these boxes.
	  
	  //I briefly touched in bootend.dic about \q, but I'll again cover it here. Pay very close attention to how this bit of dialogue is formatted. You'll see it goes \![*]\q[Displayed Name,linkedfunction]. Breaking it down, \![*] puts the balloon's option icon in front of the choice (usually a > or something), \q sets up the choice, Displayed Name which is the text that will display in the ghost's balloon, then linkedfunction, which is what the choice is linked to when the user clicks it. As you go through this file, look at how every menu option is set up, and you will see they all follow this format, give or take a \![*]. If you're going to be adding new options to menus or creating your own functions and such, make sure you follow this format and learn it well. Make sure to read the coding page of the walkthrough.

	//Advanced users, you can add multiple captions for any option you add to a menu you make just like this, as long as you separate it from the other options into its own section with two dashes above and below.

		//I also touched on this in bootend.dic and explained it in the walkthrough page on coding, but I'll also go into it here. I'm going to break down the tag there at the end of the sentence so you know what it's doing. Basically, \! means a function is going to happen, open tells it to open something, inputbox tells it to open an input box, and OnUserBornMonth is the function the input box will be linked to, which is just below here. -1 means the input box should not time out. If you want to add input boxes to some new function for whatever reason, you should follow this basic format.
		//On a related note, you can raise any function at the end of any piece of dialogue by using this format - \![raise,InsertFunctionName]. This can be handy for testing things if the function is hard to get to run otherwise.
